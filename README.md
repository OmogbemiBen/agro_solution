## Projects

### [Project: Predictive Model for Maize Yield](https://github.com/yourusername/maize-yield-prediction)
**Objective:** Develop a predictive model to estimate maize yield per hectare yearly, across different maize varieties.

- **Project Description:** This project involves building a predictive model that forecasts maize yield per hectare based on various factors such as maize variety, soil type, weather conditions, and farming practices. The goal is to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders optimize their crop production and make informed decisions about which maize varieties to plant.

- **Tools Used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, regression analysis, model evaluation
- **Outcome:** The model accurately predicts maize yield with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [insert MAE here], enabling farmers to plan better and maximize their yield. The project also provides insights into the factors that most significantly influence maize yield, helping to guide agricultural practices.

- **Key Features:**
  - Data preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key trends and correlations
  - Use of regression techniques to build and evaluate the predictive model
  - Visualization of model performance and yield predictions across different scenarios

- **Challenges Overcome:**
  - Addressed data quality issues, such as missing or inconsistent data, to improve model accuracy.
  - Implemented feature selection to identify the most impactful variables on maize yield.
  - Tuned model parameters to optimize performance and minimize prediction errors.

- **Future Work:**
  - Extend the model to include additional variables such as fertilizer usage and pest control methods.
  - Implement the model in a real-time prediction system that farmers can use during the planting season.
